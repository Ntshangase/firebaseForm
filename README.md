# module5

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was done during my MTN App Academy days.
This is a very good app. Which registered a person's details(name+surname) and their favourite podcast then stores that data into firebase.
It also displays data that is currently stored in firebase and allows the user to edit their own data.

# Running
